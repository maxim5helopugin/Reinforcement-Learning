# Reinforcement-Learning Repo
Repository to store reinforcement learning projects and experiments

# Bandits
- An experiment exploring different exploration techniques in n-armed Bandi environment
- Random eploration - choose an action randomly
- Epsilon-greedy exploration - choose a random action epsolon % of the time, otherwise choose the best action
- Softmax exploration - choose an action according to softmax distribution
- Upper Confidence Bound exploration - choose action with higher confidence
- Thompson exploration - choose an action according to a beta destribution
